POLITICS_CHARLES_MARX_DESC:0 "After completing his medical studies in the Commune of France and a brief stint practising there, Charles Marx, convinced socialist returned to his native Luxembourg. There, with secret French funding, Marx founded a hospital, secretly using it to spread socialist ideas among patients and the medical community. Indeed, it was his hospital where Luxembourg's syndicalist party was secretly founded. With Luxembourgish independence restored, and under a socialist government no less, the party appointed Marx as head of state."
